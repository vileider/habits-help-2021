	- This one is clean and simple in design but looks very data heavy focused. Not much in design aesthetics.

	- similar to flow that Calum mentioned its a focus app but gives a visual representation of progress and focus i.e. planting tree for each task and growing the Forrest as you keep going (streak).

	- I like the visual design of this one with the use of icons and progress bars not just text or charts.

	- gives the user a clear method of why they should use the app and how.

	- This is a paid app, but I thought the video on the home page highlighted some interesting points.

	- Open source, so you can fork it from GitHub and run your own instance if desired. Looks like it’s react based. UI isn’t particularly intuitive. I chose this one for myself.

	-  This one gamifies the whole thing and turns your life in to an RPG. A good idea but I’d probably spend all day on it! Might be worth looking in to this one further for inspiration.
