SQL - See-Quell

- Mainly designed for maintaining the data in relational database management systems
- Special tool used by data professionals for handling structured data (data which is stored in the form of table)
- Easily create and manipulate the database
- Access and modify the table rows and columns

Reasons why it is widely used:

- The basic use of SQL for data professionals and SQL users is to insert, update, and delete the data from the relational database.
- SQL allows the data professionals and users to retrieve the data from the relational database management systems.
- It also helps them to describe the structured data.
- It allows SQL users to create, drop, and manipulate the database and its tables.
- It also helps in creating the view, stored procedure, and functions in the relational database.
- It allows you to define the data and modify that stored data in the relational database.
- It also allows SQL users to set the permissions or constraints on table columns, views, and stored procedures.

MySQL

- Relational database management system
- An open-source database, so you don't have to pay a single penny to use it
- A very powerful program that can handle a large set of functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages
- Customizable because it is an open-source database
- Open-source GPL license facilitates programmers to modify the SQL software according to their own specific environment
- Quicker than other databases, so it can work well even with the large data set
- Support many operating systems with many languages like PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.
- Use a standard form of the well-known SQL data language
- Very friendly with PHP
- Support large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table

NoSQL

Advantages

- Can store and retrive huge amount of data
- The relationship between the data you store is not that important
- The data changing over time and is not structured
- The data is growing continuously and you need to scale the database regular to handle the data
- High scalability
- Partitioning of data and placing it on multiple machines in such a way that the order of the data is preserved is sharding
- High availability
- Auto replication feature in NoSQL databases makes it highly available because in case of any failure data replicates itself to the previous consistent state

Disadvantages

- Narrow focus
- Relational databases are a better choice in the field of Transaction Management than NoSQL
- Open-source
- Data management in NoSQL is much more complex than a relational database
- Challenge to install and even more hectic to manage on a daily basis
- GUI is not available
- Backup
- Large document size
- MongoDB and CouchDB store data in JSON format

MongoDB

- Document-oriented
- Open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling
- Available under General Public license for free, and it is also available under Commercial license from the manufacturer
- MongoDB was designed to work with commodity servers
- Support ad hoc queries
- Can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches
- Can index any field in a document
- Can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)
- Can run over multiple servers
- The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure
- Load balancing
- Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures
- Schema-less database written in C++
- Provides high performance
- Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack
- Easy to administer in the case of failures
- Support JSON data model with dynamic schemas
- Auto-sharding for horizontal scalability
- Built in replication for high availability

MariaDB

- Open-source
- Relational database management system and could be used as a great replacement of MySQL
- Can stores data in various tables
- To establish the relationship between these tables, primary keys and foreign keys are used.
- Fast, scalable and robust
- Rich ecosystem of plugins, storage engines, etc which makes it very versatile for a wide variety of use cases
- Licenced under GPL, LGPL, or BSD
- Use a standard and popular querying language
- Run on different operating systems and supports variety of programming languages
- Offer support for PHP and offer Galera cluster technology
