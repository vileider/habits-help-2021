# USER 1 PERSONA
I'm Brian Jones. I'm 44 years old. I do a lot of computer work, at different times each day. I like that my schedule is unpredictable. Recently I've been feeling a bit out of breath, and my doctor has told me I need to do more exercise. I can't be bothered going for walks, so I've enrolled in a gym, but sometimes I don't bother going for weeks at a time. I want to use a habit tracking app on either my phone or computer, which will motivate me to exercise regularly.

# USER 2 PERSONA
I'm Katarzyna Nowak. I'm 28 years old. I have two children, one in primary school and one in secondary school, and I work part-time every day. I only have a few hours in the evening to do my own things, and I've got in to a bad habit of going to bed quite late and not getting enough sleep. I wonder if a habit tracking app on my phone could help me? I know I need to try to make some time for myself during the day, but it's difficult because I only get half an hour for lunch and I often feel tired. A couple of other parents at my son's school have recommended I try a habit tracker, but I'm really not sure how it could help.

# USER 3 PERSONA
My name is Paula Wright and I'm 16 years old. I have exams coming up and I need to do a lot of revision, but I don't want to miss out on my sports and music activities that I do after school most weekdays. I've heard of habit trackers but I don't know anyone who uses one. I suppose what I'm looking for is an app on my phone that will help me to balance my time between the fun things I want to do, and the revision that I know I have to do.

# USER 4 PERSONA
I am Hernando José Francisco de la Santísima. I wish tick box, get passport.

# USER 5 PERSONA
I'm Lewis Macdonald. I'm 22 years old. I've been out of work for a couple of years and I'm finding it quite depressing. I've got a bit of a problem with my right arm which can make it difficult for me to work, although I do keep applying for jobs. My work coach at the Jobcentre told me about habit trackers. She said they're for people who want to quit smoking or remind themselves to go to the gym, but she thinks it might be useful for me to get one to help me stay focused on looking for work, even when it feels a bit hopeless. I've bought a new phone, I think it's called an Android, it was just a cheap one, so I'm looking for an app that will work on that.
